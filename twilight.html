      <p><em>Hamlet</em> is Shakespeare’s darkest and most introspective tragedy — a haunting spiral into the mind of a prince shattered by betrayal. When his father is murdered and his mother marries the killer, Hamlet is thrust into a world where trust dissolves, masks are worn, and truth bleeds.</p>
  
  <p>But this is not just a tale of revenge. It is a mirror of the soul, a meditation on madness, morality, and mortality. As Hamlet wrestles with ghosts — both literal and within himself — the reader is pulled into a world of elegant language, philosophical weight, and emotional chaos.</p>
  
  <p>Every line echoes with uncertainty: is this justice, or just another descent into ruin?</p>
  
  <p><em>Hamlet</em> remains timeless because it doesn’t hand you answers — it stares you down and asks: <strong>what would you do if your world collapsed, and no one could be trusted — not even yourself?</strong></p>
  
  <p>To read it is to walk a tightrope between reality and madness, duty and despair. It’s not just a play. It’s a wound that whispers.</p>
